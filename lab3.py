               Kingdom program. Demonstrate managing objects and class interactions.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

# Import your base class Animal and any derived classes (e.g., Bird, Fish) here from Lab 2.





# Define the Zoo class that can manage multiple Animal objects. It should have the following two methods:
# __init__ - Initialises a new Zoo instance with an empty list to hold animal objects.
# add_animal - Adds an animal to the zoo's list and confirms addition with a return message.
# You should then think of and implement at least one additional method for the Zoo class. E.g. feed_all





# Create instances of derived Animal classes and add them to the Zoo.





# Demonstrate the Zoo's functionality by calling its methods.
