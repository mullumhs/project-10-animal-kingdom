- Description: Extend the Animal Kingdom program from Lab 1 to include polymorphism,
               demonstrating method overriding in derived classes.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

# Paste your base class Animal and the derived classes from Lab 1 here.





# Modify the classes to demonstrate polymorphism through method overriding.
# Each derived class should override at least one method from the Animal class.
# For instance, you might want to override a 'make_sound' method to reflect the specific sound each animal makes.





# Create at least two instances of your derived classes





# Call the overridden methods on the instances.
