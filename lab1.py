"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

# Create a class named Animal that represents a generic animal in an animal kingdom.
# This class should have an initialiser with at least three attributes. E.g. name, age, and habitat.
# Add at least two methods for common animal behaviors. E.g. eat and sleep.





# Create at least two derived classes from the Animal class. E.g. Bird and Fish.
# Give each of the derived classes at least one specific behavior. E.g. fly and swim.





# Create at least two instances of the Animal derived classes with different data.





# Write code that prints out the details of each animal and calls their specific behaviors.
